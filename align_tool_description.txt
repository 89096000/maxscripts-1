it more for the general case of "bone is inside of cat element -> map to cat element"
6:19 PM - Daimao: using bone's position + configureable offset in the bone's direction
6:19 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): yeah that would make sense, though it depends on ur definition of "inside"
6:20 PM - Daimao: is position inside bbox
6:20 PM - Daimao: + a heuristic to select the best match
6:20 PM - Daimao: currently is based on volume
6:20 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): heuristics PogChamp
6:20 PM - Daimao: but i'll change it to distance between origins
6:20 PM - Daimao: brb
6:20 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): thank you so much for doing this man it's gonna be such a major time save
6:36 PM - Daimao: np breh
6:37 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): if u feel like continuing to maxscript after this one i could have a request for another one that would basically turn the whole process into a 2 minute ordeal, but this time save is already pretty big as it is
7:43 PM - Daimao: i've been looking at applying constraints in maxscript
7:43 PM - Daimao: it's kind of fucked up but regardless fo that
7:44 PM - Daimao: do i just keep the position XYZ & euler XYZ controllers
7:44 PM - Daimao: i assume so
7:44 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): yeah those kinda stay buried underneath
7:44 PM - Daimao: and then add them to a position/rotation list
7:44 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): when u apply a position/orientation constraint the controller becomes a list
7:44 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): yep!
7:44 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): u r mr. expert
7:44 PM - Daimao: well you have to do it manually in code
7:44 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): arigato mr. diamo
7:45 PM - Daimao: so if position xyz exists -> create position list and add position xyz to it -> then add position constraint
7:45 PM - Daimao: same w/ euler xyz
7:45 PM - Daimao: if position list already exists override position constraint?
7:45 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): hmmmmm
7:45 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): i guess so
10:10 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2) is now Online.

10:18 PM - Daimao: works on the invoker child but don't have any other testcases
10:18 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): well i'm off to test it in the adult invoker rig that i need to make  https://steamcommunity-a.akamaihd.net/economy/emoticon/demoneye  https://steamcommunity-a.akamaihd.net/economy/emoticon/demoneye
10:19 PM - Daimao: if it crashes or malfunctions send your scene file etc etc
10:19 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): yeah  https://steamcommunity-a.akamaihd.net/economy/emoticon/D
10:19 PM - Daimao: and open the maxscript listener
10:19 PM - Daimao: and look at the mapping
10:19 PM - Daimao: it prints it there!!>!>!>!>

10:51 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): i got sidetracked on feeding my cat then watering the plants
10:51 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): back onto it
10:51 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): will let u know shortly
11:25 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): alright
11:25 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): its time for me to look like a huge idiot
11:25 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): how do i actually use ur script
11:25 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): drag n dropping into viewport doesn't work

11:41 PM - Daimao: that should be Rotation_List

11:43 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): also theres something funny happening
11:43 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): when i run your script my viewport breaks
11:43 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2):  https://steamcommunity-a.akamaihd.net/economy/emoticon/m
11:43 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): it stops updating... forever
11:43 PM - Daimao: that's because it assumes it doesn't crash
11:43 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): rip
11:43 PM - Daimao: local rotList = Position_List()
11:44 PM - Daimao: really makes you think
11:44 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): :thinking:
11:44 PM - Daimao: https://github.com/Daimao/maxscripts/blob/master/cat2bone_layers.ms
11:44 PM - Daimao: download new vers
11:44 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): how did this script work on ur machine if u made errors like that
11:44 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2):  https://steamcommunity-a.akamaihd.net/economy/emoticon/m
11:44 PM - Daimao: small invokra child did not have that edge case
11:44 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): out of curiosity whats the edge case
11:45 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): :O
11:45 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): impart ur knowledge onto me sir diamo
11:45 PM - Daimao: invokra chucky had rotation lists already defined everywhere
11:45 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): ah right, b/c i'd already done the work manually
11:45 PM - Daimao: the edge case is: only Euler XYZ rotation controller
11:46 PM - Daimao: -> create rotation list -> add euler xyz -> add orientation constraint
11:46 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): yeah thats not an edge case as much as it is the core case ahaha
11:46 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): my bad
11:46 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): i should have given u the type of file that this would be applied onto 99% of the time
11:46 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): (the adult invoker)
11:46 PM - Daimao: adult invoker?
11:46 PM - Daimao: ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
11:46 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): lmao
11:46 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): it worked
11:46 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): pog
11:46 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): champ
11:46 PM - Daimao: ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
11:47 PM - Daimao: it tried to insert position list in a rotation controller
11:47 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): altho its missing a few
11:47 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/klo5d9kzxfccayl/3dsmax_2017-07-10_23-47-08.png
11:47 PM - Daimao: really activates the neurons
11:47 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): OH YEAH shit
11:47 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): i forgot to tell you
11:47 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): there is one thing that needs to be added
11:47 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): a tickbox, if you will
11:47 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): if fingers
11:48 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): do not do position constraints
11:48 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): the reason for this is b/c 3ds Max is garbage and if u apply CAT hand poses
11:48 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): in certain Max versions
11:48 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): the boxes fly out
11:48 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): HOWEVER
11:48 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): rotation is not affected
11:48 PM - Daimao: if name contains thumb index pinky ring mid -> do nathing
11:48 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): so the boxes can be all over the place but the rig still perfecltly usable via rollouts
11:48 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): if it contains the word "finger" too
11:48 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): cos thats the default name
11:48 PM - Daimao: for bone name?
11:49 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): "finger" is the default cat name
11:49 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): i would be looking at cat object names instead of skelly name
11:49 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): but thats just 2 diff ways of thinking
11:49 PM - Daimao: i'll look at invokra and see what's going wrong
11:50 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): i know exactly whats happening
11:50 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): see
11:50 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): valve
11:50 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): in their great infinite wisdom
11:50 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): their maya script that they used for dota characters
11:50 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): youll notice
11:50 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): the bones
11:50 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): are INVERSE SCALED
11:50 PM - Daimao: ?
11:50 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): i assume they dont show up like that in maya
11:51 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): one side of the character has the bones at -100% scale
11:51 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): sometimes its even flipped the other way
11:51 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): not on invoker tho
11:51 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): its so that the local axises match animation wise
11:51 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): but its kinda ass in every other way
11:51 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): it does make lots of sense from an animator standpoint tho
11:51 PM - Daimao: let's see which ones are being lil bitches
11:51 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): all the right hand side ones
11:51 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): lmao
11:52 PM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): youll notice that none of the left side bones failed to work
Tuesday, July 11, 2017
12:04 AM - Daimao: some of these failed because they were not precisely inside the bounding box of the cat bone
12:04 AM - Daimao: so i added a checkbox to purely decide based on distance
12:04 AM - Daimao: for those edge cases
12:04 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): hell yeah
12:04 AM - Daimao: now i'll do fingerbang
12:04 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): and yeah thats what i meant by sometimes there will be like a 0.1 error
12:04 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): :D
12:06 AM - Daimao: so "mid", "ring", "pinky", "index", "finger", "thumb" are the possible names?
12:07 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): yeah
12:07 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): and i guess worst case scenario ppl can easily open up the script and add their own if they want to
12:17 AM - Daimao: https://github.com/Daimao/maxscripts/blob/master/cat2bone_layers.ms
12:17 AM - Daimao: at the top of the file there's an array
12:17 AM - Daimao: local fingerStringArray = #("mid", "ring", "pinky", "index", "finger", "thumb")
12:17 AM - Daimao: you can add more names there
12:17 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): ill finger your string array
12:17 AM - Daimao: it only checks bone names
12:17 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
12:17 AM - Daimao: ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

12:17 AM - Daimao: not cat bone names
12:17 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): gotcha
12:18 AM - Daimao: if it's really needed i'll change it but it seemed to work fine for voker
12:18 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): seemsgood
12:20 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): thank u so much for this very useful tool
12:20 AM - Daimao: if i need to do more stomp me in the nutz
12:20 AM - Daimao: stomp em in the nutz
12:21 AM - Daimao: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY7qOwaZEqw
12:21 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): remember the other tool i suggested earlier? well i realized there can be something way more simple that can do the trick just as well
12:21 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): imagine the align tool,
12:21 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): except,
12:21 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): when you ask it to match rotation
12:21 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): it snaps to the closest 90° match
12:21 AM - Daimao: in what axis
12:22 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): all of them
12:22 AM - Daimao: what kind of use case do you have in mind
12:22 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): the first step of the cat rigging process basically
12:22 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): first u spawn the rig
12:22 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): then u have to align every little thing to the bones
12:22 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): then u do the constraints
12:23 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): u took care of the constraints step
12:23 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): the align step is one that can be optimized b/c
12:23 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): the tedious part is that the cat object orientation
12:23 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): and the bone orientation
12:23 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): may have flipped axises
12:23 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): like
12:23 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): 90° sideways or so
12:23 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): so if there was a smart align tool
12:23 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): that allowed me to
12:23 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): roughly align the cat rig in terms of orientation
12:24 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): and then let it snap to the closest 90 degree match
12:24 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): it would get rid having to do
12:24 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): tick align rot X rot Y rot Z
12:24 AM - Daimao: how do i decide which bone to rotate towards
12:24 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): 1) have object A selected
12:24 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): 2) click smart align button
12:25 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): 3) click object u wanna align onto
12:25 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): just like regular align tool
12:25 AM - Daimao: okey
12:25 AM - Daimao: i can do that
12:25 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): really, its just the rotation matching behaviour that needs to change
12:25 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): b/c
12:25 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): the absolute worst fucking thing to do is the fingers
12:25 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): b/c
12:25 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): they need precise alignment even more than the rest of the rig
12:26 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): cos cat comes with really amazing fingering tools
12:26 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): (lenny)
12:26 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): u can quickly pose hands with rollout odometers
12:26 AM - Daimao: ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
12:26 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): lookie here
12:27 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/yhycdfnq4oxas6e/3dsmax_2017-07-11_00-26-53.png
12:27 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): this is with multiple gizmos enabled
12:27 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): (very useful feature in the settings)
12:27 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): see how invokers finger bones have a 90 degree difference from cat objects
12:27 AM - Daimao: i c
12:28 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): well, the idea is that, as long as my cat object has a rotation thats close enough
12:28 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): kinda like this
12:28 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/yijr7s1vmadjf5s/3dsmax_2017-07-11_00-28-17.png
12:28 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): it would smartly snap to the closest match
12:28 AM - Daimao: rotation only?
12:29 AM - Daimao: or does the cat bone have to rescale/move as well
12:29 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): is it easy enough to make it snap to position like default align?
12:29 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): if not, or if you dont wanna do it, thats fine
12:29 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): doing something like ALT+A then ALT+Q is still a massive improvement
12:30 AM - Daimao: hmm
12:30 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): no scaling involved
12:30 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): its always only ever pos/rot
12:30 AM - Daimao: i need an empty example scene file
12:30 AM - Daimao: with some small thing you need aligned
12:30 AM - Daimao: to test it on
12:31 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): what if I give u the invoker rig but roughly aligned
12:31 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): would that work
12:31 AM - Daimao: yeah that's fine
12:32 AM - Daimao: i'm thinking of how to handly it smartly for everything
12:32 AM - Daimao: instead of per bone
12:32 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): if u added some sort of batch feature to this it would be a dream, but if it works just like the align tool, select A, click on "align", then click onto B, then click "ok", thats fine too
12:33 AM - Daimao: https://media.tenor.com/images/674e2fc34829ae9ddb39300345aab00e/tenor.gif

12:38 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): here u go
12:38 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): so, just to make sure theres no misunderstanding
12:38 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): the intended goal here would be
12:38 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): 1) select cat bone
12:39 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): 2) click on "smart align tool" (or its hotkey)
12:39 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): 3) click on the bone that the cat object should align to
12:39 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): 4) optionally, press OK to confirm, but i guess it would be faster if that wasnt a thing
12:39 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): and then

12:54 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): in theory you could

12:54 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): the end of chains
12:54 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): like... fingers
12:54 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): wont
12:55 AM - Daimao: i also see the 90deg angle is in bone space
12:55 AM - Daimao: not world space
12:55 AM - MaxOfS2D (working in SFM2): yep always local space here!
